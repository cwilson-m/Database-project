# B461 Database Design Project

In this project, you will be developing a database for an e-commerce website where users can buy products. There will be command-line or web interfaces to enable users to purchase products. The main entities are customers, products, and payments; although you may need additional entities like order-status, shipping and billing, taxes, etc. For meeting the project requirements, you only need a command line interface, but you will receive extra credit for web interfaces (and there is no need to produce a command line interface if that is your choice).
